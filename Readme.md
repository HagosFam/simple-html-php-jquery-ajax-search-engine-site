steps to run the project

1) you have to have wamp/ xamp server
2) clone this project to your www folder
3) run your server and go to localhost
4) create virtual host for your cloned folder
5) reload your localhost and click your newly created virtual host
6) then, you can search


Note: i tried to make the API call in php/public/index.php, but it is not working for me for probably path related reasons. then i created my php file called suggest.php and made the request to this file. That is why this project doesn't have folder.
